randomImageLoader
=================

A simple script that uses Math.random() to load a random image everytime the webpage refreshes

To insert more images: 

- Change the constant MAX (default at 6).
Note: MIN is inclusive, while MAX is exclusive i.e r = [MIN, MAX}

- Include image url in switch case.

- Voila!
